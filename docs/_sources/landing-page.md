# Preface

Welcome to this book!

These are lecture notes for Computer Science 506, _Computational Tools 
for Data Science,_ as taught by me at Boston University.

The content of the course has major contributions from Evimaria Terzi,
George Kollios, and Lance Galletti.   Errors are mine.   (Please alert
me to errors -- or better yet, submit a pull request!).

## Format

The notes are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.   Demos and most figures
are included as executable Python code.   All course materials are in
the github repository
[here.](https://github.com/mcrovella/CS506-Computational-Tools-for-Data-Science)

Each Chapter is based on a single Jupyter notebook, and each notebook
forms the basis for one lecture (more or less).

This book will evolve as the semester progresses, but once I have given
a lecture, the contents of that chapter will stay fixed except for corrections.
