# Preface

Welcome to this book!

These are lecture notes for Computer Science 506, _Geometric
Algorithms,_ as taught by me at Boston University.

The content of the course has major contributions from Evimaria Terzi,
George Kollios, and Lance Galletti.

## Format

The notes are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.   Demos and most figures
are included as executable Python code.   All course materials are in
the github repository
[here.](https://github.com/mcrovella/CS506-Computational-Tools-for-Data-Science)

Each of the Chapters is based on a single notebook, and each forms the
basis for one lecture (more or less).
